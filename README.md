#MiniQuery

**MiniQuery** is a front-end library specifically designed to be a *lightweight, compact version of JQuery*. 

**MiniQuery** comes with all the important _JQuery_ methods you know and love. This includes but is not limited to the following 
```
.html()
.eq()
.child()
.parent()
.on()
```
> A full list of its methods can be found in the [index.html](./index.html) file.

**MiniQuery** comes with the important functionality of _JQuery_ but none of the bloatware. It provides intuitive, easy to use methods for accessing, and navigating the DOM and its elements. 

**MiniQuery** allows you to easily create plugins and include them in your project.
An example of such a plugin is available in the [scroll file](PlugIns/detectScroll.js)
